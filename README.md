# About SERL
The [Smart Energy Research Lab](https://serl.ac.uk/) (SERL) will provide a secure, consistent and trusted channel for researchers to access high-resolution energy data, which will facilitate innovative energy research for years to come.

## SERL on github
We are using github to:

 * manage the collaborative development of our code base and documentation. Inevitably this means that some of our repos are private to the SERL team;
 * provide [open source](https://opensource.guide/) re-usable code examples and tips for data [users](https://opensource.guide/finding-users/);
 * enable reproducibility through transparency of code and data;
 * build a *smart energy* [community of practice](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) around the SERL data releases;
 * encourage collaboration and [contribution](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) to the SERL code base so we can all work better and faster.
