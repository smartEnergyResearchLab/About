# About SERL
The [Smart Energy Research Lab](https://serl.ac.uk/) (SERL) provides a secure, consistent and trusted channel for researchers to access high-resolution energy data, which will facilitate innovative energy research for years to come. SERL is [funded](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/P032761/1) by the UK's [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council](https://epsrc.ukri.org) (EPSRC) and comprises a [consortium](https://serl.ac.uk/about-serl/) of seven UK universities and the Energy Saving Trust.

Our initial work programme focuses on:

 * establishing a _Smart Energy [Observatory](https://serl.ac.uk/researchers/)_ of ~10,000 smart metered households across Great Britain;
 * using the _Smart Energy Observatory_ to conduct [novel energy use research](https://serl.ac.uk/projects/);
 * developing a mechanism for other researchers to access smart meter data for [other household samples](https://serl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SERL-laboratory-user-summary-v03.pdf) from whom they have obtained informed consent.

### Exploratory Data
The Smart Energy Research Lab Exploratory Data, 2019-2020 is an initial part of the SERL project and for use by SERL researchers to conduct exploratory analysis ahead of provisioning SERL data to the wider academic research community.

## SERL on github
We are using github to:

 * manage the collaborative development of our code base and documentation. Inevitably this means that some of our repos are private to the SERL team;
 * provide [open source](https://opensource.guide/) re-usable code examples and tips for data [users](https://opensource.guide/finding-users/);
 * enable reproducibility through transparency of code and data;
 * build a *smart energy* [community of practice](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) around the SERL data releases;
 * encourage collaboration and [contribution](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) to the SERL code base so we can all work better and faster.

## Tools

 * seRl [R package](https://github.com/smartEnergyResearchLab/seRl)
